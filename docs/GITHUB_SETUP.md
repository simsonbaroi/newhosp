# GitHub Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up the Hospital Bill Calculator as an open source project on GitHub.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `hospital-bill-calculator` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it public for open source
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Push Your Code

```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit initial version
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hospital Bill Calculator"

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-bill-calculator.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Actions (Optional)

If you want automated deployment:

1. Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets for deployment platforms:

**For Railway Deployment:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Your Railway API token
- `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`: Your Railway service ID

**For Render Deployment:**
- `RENDER_TOKEN`: Your Render API token
- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages (For Documentation)

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select `main` branch and `/docs` folder
4. Your documentation will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/hospital-bill-calculator`

## Repository Features

### Issues and Bug Tracking
- Bug report template included
- Feature request template included
- Labels for categorization

```

### Branch Protection

Recommended branch protection rules for `main`:
1. Require pull request reviews
2. Require status checks to pass
3. Require branches to be up to date
4. Include administrators

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will auto-deploy on every push to main
3. Environment variables are managed in Railway dashboard

### Option 2: Render

1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Configure build and start commands:
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start: `npm start`

### Option 3: Vercel

1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure for full-stack deployment
3. API routes will become serverless functions

### Option 4: Self-Hosted with Docker

```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t hospital-bill-calculator .
docker run -p 5000:5000 hospital-bill-calculator
```

## Contributing Workflow

### For Contributors

1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
4. Push branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open Pull Request

### For Maintainers

1. Review pull requests
2. Run tests locally
3. Merge when approved
4. Tag releases: `git tag v1.0.0`
5. Publish releases on GitHub
